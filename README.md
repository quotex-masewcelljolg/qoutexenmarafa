## Example of Using the Quotex Compounding Calculator

Let\'s say you invest \$1,000 with an expected profit percentage of 5%
per month. If you reinvest your profits for a period of 12 months, the
calculator will show that you can potentially earn a total profit of
\$1,628.89. This is significantly higher than if you had not reinvested
your profits, which would have resulted in a total profit of only \$600.
